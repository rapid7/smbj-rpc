 * <b>3.1.5.29 OpenPerformanceNlsText (Opnum 33)</b><br>
 * <br>
 * The OpenPerformanceNlsText method is called by the client. In response, the server opens a handle to the
 * HKEY_PERFORMANCE_NLSTEXT predefined key. The HKEY_PERFORMANCE_NLSTEXT predefined key is used to retrieve performance
 * information from a registry server using only the BaseRegQueryInfoKey, BaseRegQueryValue, BaseRegEnumValues and
 * BaseRegCloseKey methods.
 *
 * <pre>
 * error_status_t OpenPerformanceNlsText(
 *    [in, unique] PREGISTRY_SERVER_NAME ServerName,
 *    [in] REGSAM samDesired,
 *    [out] PRPC_HKEY phKey
 * );
 * </pre>
 *
 * ServerName: This SHOULD be sent as NULL and MUST be ignored on receipt because the binding to the server is already
 * complete at this stage.<br>
 * <br>
 * samDesired: This SHOULD be sent as 0 and MUST be ignored on receipt.<br>
 * <br>
 * phKey: A pointer to a variable that receives a handle to the root key HKEY_PERFORMANCE_NLSTEXT, as specified in
 * section 3.1.1.9.<br>
 * <br>
 * Return Values: This method MUST always return a 0 (ERROR_SUCCESS), even in case of errors.
 * <table border="1" summary="">
