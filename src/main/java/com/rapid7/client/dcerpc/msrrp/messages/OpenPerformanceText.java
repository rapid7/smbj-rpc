 * <br>
 * The OpenPerformanceText method is called by the client. In response, the server opens a handle to the
 * HKEY_PERFORMANCE_TEXT predefined key. The HKEY_PERFORMANCE_TEXT predefined key is used to retrieve performance
 * information from a registry server using only the BaseRegQueryInfoKey, BaseRegQueryValue, BaseRegEnumValues and
 * BaseRegCloseKey methods.
 *
 * <pre>
 * error_status_t OpenPerformanceText(
 *    [in, unique] PREGISTRY_SERVER_NAME ServerName,
 *    [in] REGSAM samDesired,
 *    [out] PRPC_HKEY phKey
 * );
 * </pre>
 *
 * ServerName: SHOULD be sent as NULL and MUST be ignored on receipt because the binding to the server is already
 * complete at this stage.<br>
 * <br>
 * samDesired: SHOULD be sent as 0 and MUST be ignored on receipt.<br>
 * <br>
 * phKey: A pointer to a variable that receives a handle to the root key HKEY_PERFORMANCE_TEXT.<br>
 * <br>
 * Return Values: This method MUST always return a 0 (ERROR_SUCCESS), even in case of errors.
 * <table border="1" summary="">
 * <tr>
 * <td>Return value/code</td>
 * <td>Description</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>ERROR_SUCCESS (0)</td>
 * <td>Always returned.</td>

 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Server Operations</b><br>
 * <br>
 * The server attempts to open the root key, HKEY_PERFORMANCE_TEXT, and return a handle to that key in the phKey
 * parameter.<br>
 * <br>
 * The server MUST create a new valid context handle. The server MUST store the context handle value in the handle table
 * (HANDLETABLE) along with a mapping to the HKEY_PERFORMANCE_TEXT key. The server MUST always return 0, even in case of
 * errors.
