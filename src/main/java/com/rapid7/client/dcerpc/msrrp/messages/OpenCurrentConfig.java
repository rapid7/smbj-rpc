/**
 * <b>3.1.5.25 OpenCurrentConfig (Opnum 27)</b><br>
 * <br>
 * The OpenCurrentConfig method is called by the client. In response, the server attempts to open a handle to the
 * HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG predefined key.
 *
 * <pre>
 * error_status_t OpenCurrentConfig(
 *    [in, unique] PREGISTRY_SERVER_NAME ServerName,
 *    [in] REGSAM samDesired,
 *    [out] PRPC_HKEY phKey
 * );
 * </pre>
 *
 * ServerName: This SHOULD be sent as NULL and MUST be ignored on receipt because the binding to the server is already
 * complete at this stage.<br>
 * <br>
 * samDesired: A bit field that describes the wanted security access for the key. It MUST be constructed from one or
 * more of the values that are specified in section 2.2.4.<br>
 * <br>
 * phKey: A handle to the root key, HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG, as specified in section 3.1.1.<br>
 * <br>
 * Return Values: The method returns 0 (ERROR_SUCCESS) to indicate success; otherwise, it returns a nonzero error code,
 * as specified in [MS-ERREF] section 2.2. The most common error codes are listed in the following table.
 * <table border="1" summary="">
 * <tr>
 * <td>Return value/code</td>
 * <td>Description</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED (0x00000005)</td>
 * <td>Access is denied.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>ERROR_WRITE_PROTECT (0x00000013)</td>
 * <td>A read or write operation was attempted to a volume after it was dismounted. The server can no longer service
 * registry requests because server shutdown has been initiated.</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Server Operations</b><br>
 * <br>
 * If the registry server can no longer service registry requests because server shutdown has been initiated, the server
 * MUST return ERROR_WRITE_PROTECT.<br>
 * <br>
 * The server attempts to open the root key, HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG, and create a new valid context handle. The server MUST
 * store the context handle value in the handle table (HANDLETABLE) along with a mapping to the HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG key.
 * The server MUST return the handle to that key in the phKey parameter. The server MUST evaluate the security
 * descriptor that is associated with the key against the requested access that is expressed in the samDesired parameter
 * to determine whether the caller has the authority to open this key.<br>
 * <br>
 * If the caller is permitted to open the key, the server MUST return 0 to indicate success and place a valid context
 * handle in the phKey parameter. If the caller does not have access, the server MUST return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED (5).
 * The server MAY return other values depending on other failure cases; other values are implementation-specific.<br>
 * <br>
 * The server validates the value of the samDesired parameter set by the client. If the value of samDesired includes
 * flags set which are not listed in section 2.2.4, the server MUST return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.<br>
 * <br>
